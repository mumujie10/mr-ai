/**
 * Multi-select rounds of the pi/omp ask tool, as they arrive over the extension
 * UI bridge.
 *
 * The CLI's rpc UI has no checkbox channel (its `select` frame carries a title
 * and option labels, nothing else), so the CLI drives a multi-select question as
 * a *loop*: it re-asks the same question after every answer, prefixing the title
 * with `(N selected) `, until the round ends through `Other (type your own)` —
 * the only row that reaches the CLI's own editor, whose text wins over the
 * toggled set when the tool formats its result.
 *
 * Answering such a frame with a label instead of the terminator toggles the
 * CLI's set and re-asks with a fresh request id, which is why every answer used
 * to stack another card. So the UI takes the round over: the card collects the
 * labels locally and one submit sends the terminator, then answers the editor
 * the CLI opens with the labels joined. Only the runtime rows a round can be
 * resumed from are parsed here; the CLI's set is never tracked — it cannot reach
 * the result anyway.
